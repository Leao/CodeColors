CodeColors is an Android library to create color resources that can be changed dynamically in Java code.
It uses reflection to inject custom preloaded colors and drawables into Resources (a nasty hack).
Use it with discretion, as it is not guaranteed to work with every device.
When it is not supported, it should _not_ cause any crashes.

CodeColors is still under heavy development.
